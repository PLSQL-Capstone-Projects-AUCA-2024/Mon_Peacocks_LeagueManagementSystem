# üìñ League Management system <a name="about-project"></a>


**League Management System** The League Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to assist football associations in efficiently managing league operations. This software streamlines key functions such as team and player registration, match scheduling, referee assignments, and real-time tracking of match results. LMS automates league standings updates, supports player transfers, and ensures accurate, transparent records across the league. With features tailored for administrators, team managers, referees, and coaches, LMS enhances decision-making, fosters collaboration, and promotes seamless communication, ultimately contributing to a more organized and competitive league environment.

## üöÄ Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>
This project is currently designed for on-premises use and does not have a live demo.
Here is ERD (Logical model) for League Management System

### Swimlane
A detailed, logical data model for The League Management Sytem  project, incorporating all required entities, attributes, and relationships using SQL Developer.


![LF drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39ed2cf0-ee45-443e-ab9a-7718c032d969)

The logical model provided includes primary and foreign keys, as well as other constraints where applicable.
Primary Keys: Match_ID, Team_ID,Player_ID,Season_ID, Stadium_ID,Coach_ID, TeamPlayer_ID, Transfer_ID  

Foreign Keys:FK_MATCH_AWAY_TEAM,FK_MATCH_HOME_TEAM,FK_TEAM_COACH etc.

## EXPLANATION
The Logical data model optimizes data storage and retrieval by organizing information into distinct tables with specific relationships, thereby reducing redundancy and enhancing data retrieval efficiency. Each entity, such as Teams, Players, Matches, Seasons, Stadiums, Transfers, and Coaches, has its own table with primary keys for unique identification and foreign keys that establish connections with related tables. For example, the Matches table references Teams, Stadiums, Referees, and Seasons, which prevents duplication of team and stadium details across multiple match records. The Transfers table handles player movements between teams with foreign keys, ensuring that each transfer record accurately links to players and teams involved. This relational approach minimizes data duplication and enables fast queries, as data is retrieved by joining related tables based on indexed keys rather than scanning large, repetitive datasets. By normalizing the design, it maintains data integrity and consistency, making it scalable and efficient for handling large datasets in sports management scenarios

## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>


To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

You need to have git installed and the desired code editor (SQL developer or datagrip are recommended)

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone git@github.com:PLSQL-Capstone-Projects-AUCA-2024/Mon_Peacocks_LeagueManagementSystem.git
```

### Usage

To run the project in development mode, execute the following command:

To create tables
```shell
-- 1. Stadiums Table
CREATE TABLE Stadiums
(
    stadium_id       NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    stadium_name     VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    city             VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    capacity         NUMBER,
    established_year NUMBER(4)
);

-- 2. Coaches Table
CREATE TABLE Coaches
(
    coach_id         NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name       VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name        VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    nationality      VARCHAR2(50),
    experience_years NUMBER
);
  
  Create More tables.....

```


To insert data
```shell
-- 1. Insert sample data into Coaches

INSERT INTO Coaches (first_name, last_name, nationality, experience_years)
VALUES ('Habimana', 'Innocent', 'Rwanda', 12);

INSERT INTO Coaches (first_name, last_name, nationality, experience_years)
VALUES ('Rukundo', 'Samuel', 'Rwanda', 8);

INSERT INTO Coaches (first_name, last_name, nationality, experience_years)
VALUES ('Mukamisha', 'Vestine', 'Rwanda', 5);



-- 2. Insert sample data into Stadiums
INSERT INTO Stadiums (stadium_name, city, capacity, established_year)
VALUES ('Amahoro Stadium', 'Kigali', 25000, 1987);

INSERT INTO Stadiums (stadium_name, city, capacity, established_year)
VALUES ('Nyamirambo Regional Stadium', 'Kigali', 12000, 1986);

INSERT INTO Stadiums (stadium_name, city, capacity, established_year)
VALUES ('Huye Stadium', 'Huye', 8000, 2015);


Insert more values .....

```
